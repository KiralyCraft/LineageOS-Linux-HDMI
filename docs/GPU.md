# GPU acceleration on the chroot displays

This note records live results from the Xperia 1 V (`pdx234`, Adreno 740) on
2026-09-01. It distinguishes the Termux:X11 display from the Xorg server that
owns the external display through a DRM lease. They use the same chroot Mesa
installation but expose different rendering interfaces to clients.

## Installed GPU paths

Android exposes all of the relevant nodes to the chroot:

```text
/dev/kgsl-3d0
/dev/dri/card0       (msm_drm)
/dev/dri/renderD128
```

The chroot has Mesa 26.2.0, the DRI loader shim, the Turnip Vulkan ICD, and the
Freedreno Xorg DDX. A headless `vulkaninfo --summary` sees:

```text
deviceName = Turnip Adreno (TM) 740
driverName = turnip Mesa driver
```

The interactive `kiraly` shell sets these in `.bashrc`:

```sh
export MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=kgsl
export TU_DEBUG=noconform
```

They are below the interactive-shell guard in `.bashrc`. A non-interactive
`runuser -l kiraly -c ...` does not receive them. A normal interactive login
does.

## Live result matrix

| Display and environment | Renderer | Accelerated | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Termux:X11 `:0`, interactive `kiraly` login | native Freedreno `FD740` | yes | Works |
| Leased Xorg `:1`, default LXDE environment | Mesa llvmpipe | no | Works, but CPU-rendered |
| Leased Xorg `:1`, `GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink` | Zink over Turnip Adreno 740 | yes | Works |
| Leased Xorg `:1`, interactive-login `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=kgsl` | none | no | Loader cannot retrieve the device; the client disconnects |

The software `glxgears` run measured approximately 40 and 22 FPS. The Zink
over Turnip run measured approximately 504 and 467 FPS. These are diagnostic
figures, not a general graphics benchmark.

The exact native-Freedreno login test succeeded on Termux:X11 `:0`:

```text
OpenGL vendor string: freedreno
OpenGL renderer string: FD740
Accelerated: yes
```

The same login environment against leased Xorg `:1` reported:

```text
MESA-LOADER: failed to retrieve device information
XIO: fatal IO error ... on X server ":1"
```

Only the GL client disconnected. Xorg and the takeover remained healthy.

## Why the leased display differs

The known-safe takeover deliberately configures Xorg with:

```text
Driver "modesetting"
Option "AccelMethod" "none"
Option "PageFlip" "false"
Option "ShadowFB" "true"
Option "Atomic" "true"
Option "SWcursor" "true"
```

The Xorg log confirms that glamor is disabled, the screen is not DRI2-capable,
and GLX initializes the `DRISWRAST` provider. The DRI3 extension exists at the
server level, but this screen does not provide the screen-level DRI3 interface
needed by the KGSL loader. This is why copying the interactive-login KGSL
override to `:1` does not reproduce Termux:X11's native Freedreno path.

Zink is the narrower working solution. Setting only `GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink`
allows a GLX client on `:1` to render through Vulkan Turnip/KGSL while keeping
the already-tested ShadowFB scanout and DRM ioctl behavior. Do not also set
`MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=kgsl` on the leased display.

The X server's 2D rendering remains software-based in this configuration.
OpenGL applications can nevertheless be GPU-accelerated through Zink.

## Reproducing the checks

For Termux:X11, run from an interactive `kiraly` shell:

```sh
DISPLAY=:0 glxinfo -B
DISPLAY=:0 glxgears -info
```

During an active leased-Xorg session, the working accelerated client path is:

```sh
DISPLAY=:1 \
XAUTHORITY=/run/hdmi-los/Xauthority \
GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink \
glxinfo -B
```

To pin the tested Vulkan ICD explicitly for diagnosis:

```sh
DISPLAY=:1 \
XAUTHORITY=/run/hdmi-los/Xauthority \
GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink \
VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/freedreno_icd.aarch64.json \
glxgears -info
```

The current agent starts LXDE directly with `dbus-run-session`; it does not
start an interactive login shell. Making Zink the LXDE default therefore needs
an explicit environment setting in the agent. That change should be tested as
a separate candidate. Enabling glamor, DRI3, or the Freedreno DDX changes the
X server/KMS path itself and requires the full crash-evidence protocol before
it can replace the stable ShadowFB configuration.

## Starting the takeover as `kiraly`

From a terminal inside the mounted chroot:

```sh
cd /home/kiraly/Downloads/hdmi-los-runtime
./run-agent.sh --capture none
```

`run-agent.sh` automatically re-executes itself through passwordless
`sudo -n`; it is expected to remain in the foreground. Leave that terminal
open, then tap the `HDMI Xorg` Quick Settings tile on Android. Pressing
`Ctrl-C` stops the waiting chroot agent. The tile, volume-button escape, and
60/65-second deadlines restore Android.

The `0.2.5-diagnostic.1` module disables ordinary tile activation. With that
older diagnostic package installed, start the foreground agent as above and
trigger the takeover separately from an Android root shell:

```sh
/data/adb/modules/hdmi-los/bin/hdmi-losd probe xorg-atomic
```

Release `0.2.6-candidate.1` enables the tile and selects the same atomic probe
mode without requiring that separate root command.
